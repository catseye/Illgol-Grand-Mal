Welcome to Open Sores Illgol##!

Yes, the next generation of the Illgol family of language has arrived, and
you are welcome to hack on it like there's no tomorrow.

In order to try to make absolutely everyone happy, Illgol## is
octuply-licensed.  See the file COPING for license information.

Because Illgol## supercedes Illgol, Illgola-2, and Illberon, Cat's Eye
Technologies, in the spirit of large software corporations whom we
all dearly love, has DISCONTINUED those products.  After all, Illgol## is
far, far better than any of them, so why would you need them anymore?
Nah, ya don't.  Trust us.  Illgol## is far, far better.  After all, it's
the latest version, so it must be better.  Old versions are obsolete and
if you have an old version we encourage you to delete it completely in
favour of the new Open Sores Illgol## which is much, much better.

Upgrade now!!!
