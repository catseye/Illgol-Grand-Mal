<p>Welcome to Illgola-2, the logical extension of
the mental instability that is <a href="/projects/illgol/">ILLGOL</a>,
and possibly the first language ever to have a cartoon
superheroine affiliated
with its release notes.

<p>Watch as the frightful mass of code that is the ILLGOL compiler
tries desperately to cope with with cuts, continuations,
lambda functions, and video DAC's.  Let it convince you of the
fruitlessness of trying anything else for all your programming
needs and conveniencies.

<p>Download the <a HREF="/projects/illgola-2-2000.0420.zip">illgola-2-2000.0420.zip</A>
distribution which includes the compiler executables.

<p>Marvel at that into which the <a href="illgola-2.txt">release notes</a>
evolve!

<p>Astound your friends and co-workers with <a href="../prj/">Illgola-2 example
source code</a>.
